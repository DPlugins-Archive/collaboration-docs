# Why Collaboration

[Collaboration](https://dplugins.com/collaboration) is a plugin for Oxygen Editor and adding support for Multi User and Multi Tab Editing.

Even **Elementor** doesn't have this kind feature / plugin ðŸ˜Ž

**Collaborating and working together made easy!**


## The Problem

Oxygen Builder is a powerful visual editing for WordPress website. With the granular control on the Oxygen Editor page, you can achive a beautiful website and many aspect that may not available on another WordPress visual editing or page builder plugin. 

The [official documentation](https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/other/multi-user-editing-edit-locking/) recommend using a single tab when working with Oxygen to avoid issues where one tab is saving older data than another, resulting in overwriting your new changes. The same scenario can occur when two or more users are working in Oxygen at the same time.


### Global styles, classes, and settings mechanism

Because of the way Oxygen saves global styles, classes, and settings, multi-user or multi-tab editing with Oxygen is highly discouraged.
